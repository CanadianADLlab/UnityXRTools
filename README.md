Unity Version: 2020.1.17f1

This project contains various tools for VR interactions using the Unity XR plugin. Built with URP, if you're project has SRP all the materials will be pink, but the vr itself should still work correctly.

Tools contained

- Locomotion character controller
- Teleport character controller
- Grabbing both 1 handed and 2 handed
- Interactions with physical objects such as levels, dials and buttons
- Vr interaction with standard unity ui
- Climbing 
- Gun shooting/reloading


Project Setup

I recommend using a unity version that is the same or newer than the unity version listed above. It will most likely work with older versions that unity xr is supported by, 
but just to be safe. Also, before using the xr samples for your own project I recommend trying out the test scenes which I explain below.
Once you have the project open all of the sample interactions created will be located under the Project folder.

<br><br>
The project folder has two main example scenes for you to play around with. Both are located in the scenes folder the first one is just called example scene. This scene
contains interactions for grabbing,shooting,climbing and ui. Also it contains the locomotion character controller to move around.

<br><br>
The next scene is called GenericInteractions and this contains all the physical interactions you can do. 
The scene lets players control a drone in different ways using dials levers and buttons.

<h1> Importing the Unity Package</h1>

If you decide to use the unity package once imported there are a few things to set up in order for this to work. 

1) Go to Edit->ProjectSettings->PackageManager and ernable preview packages.
2) Go to Window->PackageManager and go to UnityRegistry
3) Install XR Plugin Management and XR Interaction Toolkit(this is preview so MAKE SURE PREVIEWS ARE ENABLED)
4) If you are using a headset that requires steam vr you need to also install this package for the open vr to work https://github.com/ValveSoftware/unity-xr-plugin/releases/tag/v1.1.4
5) Go Edit->ProjectSettings->XRPlug-In Management and check of the devices you would like to support.

<h1>An overview of the scripts</h1>
I'm going to break down the scripts here and explain all the variables that you can change via the inspector.

<h1>Input</h1>

<h3>XRCrossPlatformInputManager</h3>
Singleton class that contains all the input states for xr. If you need to get input use this script. The functions that will give input are.
<br>
GetInputByButton(ButtonTypes inputButton, ControllerHand hand, bool hold)
<br>
This function takes the ButtonTypes inputbutton which is the input you are listening for (ButtonTypes.Grip would return a grip pressed state).
The ControllerHand is the hand you are looking for if ControllerHand.Left it will return true when left grip is pressed.
And last is the bool hold, if hold is true it will keep returning true while the user is holding the grip, if false it will only return true on button down.
<br>
GetInputUp(ButtonTypes inputButton, ControllerHand hand)
<br>
This behavces the same as the first function but only return input up, I found I rarely use this so it got its own function
<br>
<h3>XRPositionManager</h3>
Singleton script just keeps track of all the vr specific objects like hands,camera and playspace. Useful for checking states an example use would be seeing if the leftcontroller was grabbing. XRPositionManager.Instance.LeftController.GetComponent<Controller>().IsGrabbing
<h3>Controller</h3>
