Project Setup

I recommend using a unity version that is the same or newer than the unity version listed above. It will most likely work with older versions that unity xr is supported by, 
but just to be safe.
Once you have the project open all of the sample interactions created will be located under the Project folder.

The project folder has two main example scenes for you to play around with. Both are located in the scenes folder the first one is just called example scene. This scene
contains interactions for grabbing,shooting,climbing and ui. Also it contains the locomotion character controller to move around.

<br><br>
The next scene is called GenericInteractions and this contains all the physical interactions you can do. 
The scene lets players control a drone in different ways using dials levers and buttons.
